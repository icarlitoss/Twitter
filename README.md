The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] User can load more tweets once they reach the bottom of the feed using infinite loading similar to the actual Twitter client.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
One of the main challenges was to help to get through the videos but it was possible to do it thanks to the wonderful doc made my the students leaders Katherine and Tejen.
I had been struggleing with autoLayout but now it is getting ebtter. Practice makes it better.
